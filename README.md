# minimumWageSupplyVsDemand

According to the laws of supply and demand, price controls interfere with the optimal behavior of the market. In the case of minimum wage, there should be a surplus of labor in comparison to the number of jobs available. In order to test this, we are looking to see if there is any correlation with minimum wage increases and unemployment. 

Does raising the minimum wage negatively impact demand for labor?
We ask two smaller questions within this overarching question. First, if we make the naive assumption that the price of labor, all else being equal, is the determinant of demand for labor, then it follows that when minimum wage increases, unemployment also increases because we have a surplus of labor. For example, if we increased the minimum wage to 50K salary ($25/hour for 40 hours a week at 50 weeks annually), most everyone in the world would jump for the opportunity, but there are not that many 50k salary jobs, so we have too many workers and not enough jobs. These extra workers would then be counted as unemployed.
